For any use or redistribution of the data, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the data and keep intact any notices on the original data.

This licence does not apply to the website, vector tiles, or other hosted data which is only to be used via the official NPT website. You must not link, embed, scrape or otherwise use the constituent parts of the website.

### Route network data with cycling potential and quietness attributes

The route network dataset can be downloaded as a GeoPackage from [github.com/nptscot/npt/releases](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases). New versions are released monthly for the duration of the project (e.g., [rnet_2025-05-01.gpkg](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases/download/v2025-05-01/rnet_2025-05-01.gpkg) for the May 2025 release of the route network data with cycling potential and quietness attributes).

### Cycling level of service data

The cycling level of service dataset can be downloaded as a GeoPackage from [https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases). New versions are released monthly (e.g., [clos_2025-05-01.gpkg](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases/download/v2025-05-01/clos_2025-05-01.gpkg) for the May 2025 release). This dataset contains the cycling level of service data, including estimated motor traffic levels, current cycling infrastructure, speed limits and inferred level of service.

#### Street space data terms and conditions

Contains [OS data](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/customers/public-sector/public-sector-licensing/copyright-acknowledgments) Â© Crown copyright and database rights 2025 OS licence number 100046668.

- You are not permitted to copy, sub-license, distribute, sell or otherwise make available the licensed data to third parties in any form; and
- Third party rights to enforce the terms of this licence shall be reserved to OS.

The streetspace dataset contains estimates of the widths of non-residential streets and pavements in Scotland, and calculates which types of cycle tracks could be fitted to the streetspace, with results provided at the level of [Ordance Survey OpenRoads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-roads) dataset. It can be downloaded as a GeoPackage from [https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases). New versions are released monthly (e.g., [streetspace_2025-05-01.gpkg](https://github.com/nptscot/npt/releases/download/v2025-05-01/streetspace_2025-05-01.gpkg) for the May 2025 release).

## Data sources

The NPT is based on the following data sources:

- Aggregated journey to work origin-destination data from the 2011 Census at the Data Zone level (source: National Records of Scotland)
- Aggregated data on the number of pupils travelling to school in each Data Zone in Scotland from the 2021 Scottish Pupil Census
- Data on modal shares of pupils travelling to individual schools from the Hands Up Scotland Survey 2020 (source: Sustrans Scotland, used with permission from individual local authorities)
- OpenStreetMap data downloaded with the [`osmactive`](https://nptscot.github.io/osmactive/) R package (source: OpenStreetMap)
- Ordnance Survey [Open Roads](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-open-roads) data (source: Ordnance Survey)
- Ordnance Survey [MasterMap Highways](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-mastermap-highways-network-roads) data, which provided information on carriageway widths, presented as width categories in the StreetSpace layer which is partly derived from this data (source: Ordnance Survey)
- Ordnance Survey [MasterMap Topography](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/os-mastermap-topography-layer) data, which provided information on pavement geometries, presented as width categories in the StreetSpace layer which is partly derived from this data (source: Ordnance Survey)
- Ordnance Survey [Code-Point](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/code-point) data to inform the destinations of simulated utility trips (source: Ordnance Survey)
